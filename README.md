# Virtual Museum Thesis: interactive web presentation
A final presentation for my honors thesis that showcases the findings of a year-long research in an engaging and accessible manner.
I came up with an idea of an interactive presentation to support my thesis conclusion that museums need to explicitly reinvent their material for a hyperlinked, juxtaposed space of the web. Therefore, I also reinvinted the form of my final presentation to be an interactive page that mimics an aesthetic of a gallery.
The page was coded with jQuery, with the most exciting features being click-and-drop frames and statues and a "juxtaposition generator" that pulls images of different museum galleries via an API.
